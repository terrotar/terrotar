- :computer: I enjoy a lot of areas, such as Web Development, machine learning, AI and security but mostly of my projects are from Web and focused in Python back-end.
- :office: I'm working currently with Data Science as a Back-End Developer.



### About me :wink:

I'm a programmer focused in web development Back-End, but not limited to that area. I have a couple projects, including API's, Blogs, and other themes, mostly of them developed in Python/Flask with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. Feel free to contact me and clone, comment or whatever with my projects, just please give the reference of my GitHub if you use them =]



- [Courses](https://www.impacta.edu.br/graduacoes/analise-e-desenvolvimento-de-sistemas) :mortar_board: - It's a technology course of 2 years(I'm in the last one) of Development and Analisys of Systems by Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia.

:blue_book: Usually I study by Documentation of the tools I use, like Flask, Bootstrap, API's and libraries.
